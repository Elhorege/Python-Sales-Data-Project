# Sales Data Analysis Report

This report explores various key aspects of our sales dataset, focusing on top-performing products, sales trends by country, the relationship between product price and quantity sold, and return analysis.

## Data Preparation and Cleanup

To prepare the data for analysis, I created a new column for **Total Revenue** and handled any negative quantities by treating them as returns. Below are the steps taken for data preparation:

```python
#Renaming Columns
df.rename(columns={'InvoiceNo' : 'Invoice Number' , 'StockCode' : 'Product Code' , 'CustomerID' : 'Customer ID'}, inplace=True)
#Filling Missing Values and Changing Data Type
df['Customer ID'] = df['Customer ID'].fillna(0).astype(int)
# Creating 'Total Revenue' column
df['Total Revenue'] = df['Quantity'] * df['UnitPrice']

# Handling returns and adjusting quantities
df['Return'] = df['Quantity'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x < 0 else 0)
df['Quantity'] = df['Quantity'].apply(lambda x: x if x > 0 else 0)
```

### Key Columns:
- **Invoice Number**
- **Product Code**
- **Description**
- **Quantity**
- **InvoiceDate**
- **UnitPrice**
- **Customer ID**
- **Country**
- **Return**
- **Total Revenue** (calculated)

## The Analysis

The analysis revolves around key metrics like top products by quantity and total revenue, top-performing countries, sales trends over time, and return analysis.

### 1. Top Products by Quantity

To find the top products based on quantity sold, I grouped the data by product description and summed the quantities:

```python
top_products = df.groupby('Description')['Quantity'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
top_products = top_products.iloc[::-1]
px.bar(data_frame=top_products, x='Quantity', title='Top Products by Quantity')
```

#### Results:
- The **Top 10 products by quantity** graph highlights the products that have been sold the most.

### 2. Top Products by Total Revenue

For revenue analysis, I calculated total revenue for each product:

```python
top_revenue_product = df.groupby('Description')['Total Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
top_revenue_product = top_revenue_product.iloc[::-1]
px.bar(data_frame=top_revenue_product, x='Total Revenue', title='Top Products by Total Revenue')
```

#### Results:
- This shows the **Top 10 products by revenue**, providing insights into the most profitable products.

### 3. Top 10 Countries by Quantity Sold

To explore which countries contribute most to product sales by quantity, I aggregated the quantity data by country:

```python
top_products_byCountry = df.groupby('Country')['Quantity'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
top_products_byCountry = top_products_byCountry.iloc[::-1]
px.bar(data_frame=top_products_byCountry, x='Quantity', title='Top 10 Countries by Quantity')
```

#### Results:
- The **Top 10 countries by quantity sold** graph reveals the most active markets.

### 4. Top 10 Countries by Total Revenue

I calculated the total revenue generated by each country to identify top revenue sources:

```python
top_products_byCountry = df.groupby('Country')['Total Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
top_products_byCountry = top_products_byCountry.iloc[::-1]
px.bar(data_frame=top_products_byCountry, x='Total Revenue', title='Top 10 Countries by Total Revenue')
```

#### Results:
- The **Top 10 countries by total revenue** graph displays the top countries contributing to overall revenue.

### 5. Total Revenue by Date

By resampling the data by month, I analyzed the revenue trends over time:

```python
date_Country = df[['InvoiceDate', 'Total Revenue']].set_index('InvoiceDate').resample(rule='1ME').nunique()
px.line(data_frame=date_Country, y='Total Revenue', title='Total Revenue by Date')
```

#### Results:
- The **Total Revenue by Date** line graph tracks monthly revenue trends, showing sales patterns over time.

### 6. Relationship between Product Price and Quantity Sold

I explored the correlation between unit price and quantity sold using a scatter plot:

```python
px.scatter(df, x='UnitPrice', y='Quantity', title='Relationship between Product Price and Quantity Sold')
```

#### Results:
- The **Price vs. Quantity Sold** scatter plot visualizes how product pricing affects sales volume.

### 7. Total Returns by Country

For return analysis, I grouped the data by country to see which markets had the most product returns:

```python
returns_by_country = df.groupby('Country')['Return'].sum().reset_index().sort_values(by='Return', ascending=False).head(10)
px.bar(returns_by_country, x='Country', y='Return', title='Total Returns by Country')
```

#### Results:
- The **Total Returns by Country** graph reveals the countries with the highest return rates.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights key trends in product sales, revenue distribution, and return patterns across different countries. The insights will guide future sales strategies, especially in identifying top products, optimizing pricing, and targeting high-revenue markets while managing returns.
